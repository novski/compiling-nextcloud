This repository contains a How-To guide for compiling the Nextcloud

### How to contribute

When you have a guide you would like to contribute please send it as a pull
request. It would be great if it follows the three guidlines bellow.

**File Structure**
Please create for each release a seperate file. This way the guides are
logically separated. e.g. Windows/Windows_7.md. Linux distributions should each
have it's own folders. e.g. Linux/Debian/Debian_Jessie.md

**Formating**

The guides should be written in Github's Markdown syntax. This way they get
nicely formated when you view them on Github.
The syntax can be found here:

Please limit the line length to 80 or less. Exceptions are paths and URLs.

**Credits**
If you take instructions from another source please provide a link to the 
website at the end of the guide under a level 3 headding likes this:
